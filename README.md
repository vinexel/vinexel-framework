> “Think different. Build the Vinexel way.” — _Vinexel Pioneers_

Vinexel is a next-generation **PHP framework** engineered for **high-performance, multi-domain, and modular architectures**.  
It combines the elegance of modern ecosystem, the power of H-MVC Multi-Project, and the flexibility of custom architecture — all written in clean, modern PHP 8.3+ syntax.

It’s not just a framework — it’s an **ecosystem** that powers entire platforms, including **multi: e-commerce, SSO services, SaaS, and enterprise-grade system.**

---

## Core Philosophy

Vinexel was built to provide a **stable, flexible, and modern foundation** for developers who demand more control over every layer of their applications.  
Its design focuses on:

- **Clarity** — clean separation of domains, adapters, and infrastructure.
- **Consistency** — predictable structure across projects.
- **Performance** — optimized PDO queries, Redis integration, and lightweight autoloading.
- **Scalability** — multi-domain support for SaaS and enterprise platforms.

---

## Architectural Overview

Vinexel adopts a **Hybrid Modular H-MVC Multi-Project** pattern enriched with **Clean Architecture principles**, which means:

Each domain (e.g., yourdomain1, yourdomain2, yourdomain3) is isolated yet powered by the same core — enabling **multi-tenant** or **multi-project** management from a single Vinexel instance.

## Key Features

### Modular & Scalable Architecture

- H-MVC + Multi-Project principle structure with domain isolation.
- Fully PSR-4 compliant autoloading.
- Modular routing with per-domain route files.

### Security & Middleware

- **Session-based authentication** with traits:
  - `Protection` → Enforces login access.
  - `Restriction` → Prevents redundant login.
- **Flasher** library for real-time notification messages.
- **CSRF-safe form submissions** and input sanitization.

### Redis Integration

- Custom-built internal **Redis engine** (`Deeper\Libraries\Redis`)
- Session, cache, and flash message handling faster than Predis.
- Supports **SSO (Single Sign-On)** for seamless multi-application authentication.

### Database Layer

- Built-in **PDO Query Builder** via `Vision\Modules\Database`.
- Secure prepared statements and bound parameters.
- Methods: `query()`, `bind()`, `execute()`, `single()`, `rowCount()`, and `lastInsertId()`, etc.

### View System

- Integrated custom **Twig** for **Rapid Templating Engine**.
- Supports file extensions `.php` pure native syntax and `.rapid.php` for custom rapid comprehensive templating engine.
- Global view helpers (`asset()`, `getUserData()`, `getUserEmail()`).

### User Management

- Authentication system with `Protection` and `Restriction`.
- Password hashing, email verification, and activation codes.
- PIN-based recovery system with secure update methods.

### Installer & Environment Bootstrapping

- **Dynamic installer** (`InstallForms` + `BaseModel::installer()`)
- Auto-configures admin credentials on first setup.
- Supports `.env` + fallback to `config.php`.

### Multi-Domain & SaaS Support

- Intelligent domain detection at runtime.
- Domain-to-project routing for example:
  - `127.0.0.1:8000` → `Project1`
  - `127.0.0.1:8001` → `Project2`
  - `127.0.0.1:8002` → `Project3`
  - and more unlimited projects

### Flash & Session Utilities

- `Flasher` and `Session` built into the framework core.
- Instant notifications with styles (Bootstrap/Tailwind).
- Session persistence using Redis backend.

### CLI & Development Tools

- Vinexel CLI for creating controllers, models, routes, and migrations.
- `php vision make:model User` → instantly scaffolds model classes.
- Supports multiple environments: `development`, `testing`, `production`.
